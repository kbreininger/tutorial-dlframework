    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have had an incredible impact on research in medical imaging and medical signal processing in recent years. Frameworks like TensorFlow, Caffe and PyTorch make it easy to implement network architectures  to carry out experiments by simply stacking together operators. This has helped to speed up research immensely - it is easy to try out new ideas and translate insights from other fields. BUT: Never having to understand the technical details of the frameworks and operators deprives researchers of one avenue to potential innovation in the field. Improvements like trainable region-proposals and depth-wise separable convolutions are easier to come up with a thorough understanding the details of the machinery. Many essential advances in DL, such as the ReLU, batch normalization and better initialization strategies, have originated in understanding and improving drawbacks of building blocks in neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this tutorial, we aim to support you in understanding what's going in neural network frameworks in detail, and teach you how the most common operators work during inference in a network and how they are adapted by training. This will enable you to implement a broader range of ideas, relying on innovative new operators embedded into neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "As prerequisites we expect some conceptual knowledge about neural networks as acquired in offline or online courses, like the [Stanford DL course](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/), or our course ([DL_course_videos](https://www.video.uni-erlangen.de/clip/id/8947)), as well as basic Python/NumPy programming experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "- How it works:\n",
    "    - We provide the necessary math and code skeletons of building blocks\n",
    "    - You translate this math into code\n",
    "    - Our unit-tests will give you feedback on the correctness of your implementation\n",
    "    - At the end, we will put these building blocks together to a working network\n",
    "- What we don't do:\n",
    "    - Teach you Python programming\n",
    "    - Teach you about the fundamentals of machine learning\n",
    "    - Give a thorough introduction into the subject of deep learning\n",
    "    - Implement a framework with a focus on performance and efficiency\n",
    "- Elements in this tutorial\n",
    "    - Implementing a multilayer perceptron framework\n",
    "    - Extending this framework with state-of-the-art initialization\n",
    "    - Adding the basic operators of CNNs\n",

    "## The General Idea of the Framework\n",
    "<a id='network_description'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all tasks in this tutorial will revolve around implementing \"layers\". All layers are derived from the base class defined in the next cell. Each layer needs to implement the methods ```forward``` and ```backward```. We will use the term \"layer\" to represent any operator in the network that can be considered as a \"unit\" during forward and backward pass, e.g., a \"fully connected layer\", an \"activation layer\" or a \"loss layer\". \n",
    "\n",
    "In ```forward(x)```, the forward pass of the layer is computed by applying the respective operation to the input ```x```. Furthermore, intermediate results necessary to compute the gradients in the backward pass have to be stored. \n",
    "In ```backward(error)```, the layer receives the error passed down from the subsequent layer, updates its parameters accordingly and returns the error with respect to its input.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, a simple network for classification can be expressed by a list of layer objects. Given an initial input ```x``` and a corresponding ```label```, the forward pass through the network is computed by subsequently calling ```forward``` for each layer in the list. The respective output is passed as input to the next layer. The very last layer, the \"loss\" layer, additionally receives the label to compute the loss. To adapt the weights in each layer, we then go backwards through the list, calling ```backward```, backpropagating the error through the network. The network is trained by alternating the forward and backward pass through the network while iterating through the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "During test-time, only the forward pass through the network is computed to generate a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic notation and terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "We will work with the following notation and terminology:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{X}$ and $\\mathbf{x}$ represent the input, \n",
    "- $\\mathbf{W}$ and $\\mathbf{w}$ the trainable weights/parameters and\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{Y}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$ the output of a layer.\n",
    "- $L$ represents the loss. Accordingly,\n",
    "- $E_\\mathbf{Y} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\mathbf{Y}}$ is the error passed down from the subsequent layer,\n",
    "- $E_\\mathbf{W} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\mathbf{W}}$ the error with respect to the weights and\n",
    "- $E_\\mathbf{X} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\mathbf{X}}$ is the error with respect to the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $x$ and $y$ always have \"local\" meaning, i.e., with respect to the __current__ layer. The $y$ of the previous layer is the $x$ to the next, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Have a look at the class definitions below and make yourself familiar with the concepts before continuing with the next part of the tutorial, the fully connected layer."

    "Historically, the Sigmoid function has played a big role in the development of neural networks. Given the motivation of biological neurons and their all-or-nothing response, the sigmoid is an obvious choice close to a true step function: It scales the input between 0 and 1, and its gradient exists everywhere.\n",

    "While the sigmoid function is still frequently used for example in recurrent networks and as the last layer for binary segmentation/classification, it has been overtaken by the rectified linear unit (ReLU) and its variants in many other setting.\n",
    "The main drawback of the sigmoid function is that its gradient is close to zero everywhere apart from a small region around the origin. This can cause the so-called vanishing gradient problem, meaning that the network will learn very slow or will stop learning completely. The ReLU is much less affected by this problem, as the output is linear for inputs $>0$:\n",

    "\n",
    "Initialization is very critical for non-convex optimization problems, and neural networks are no exception. The most simple strategy is initialization with a constant value, which is frequently used for bias initialization. Generally, bias initialization with a constant of 0 is common, however, with ReLU as activation function, a small positive value is sensible to reduce the risk of \"dying ReLUs\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "For other weights in FC layers and for weights in convolutional layers that we will look at in a bit, we need a different initialization strategy. If all weights are initialized with the same value, each node would receive the same update and training becomes impossible. One option to break this symmetry is uniform random initialization. Each element of $\\mathbf{W}$ is drawn from a uniform distribution with a certain range, commonly [0, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "However, even with random initialization, finding the right range for weights is still tricky. If the weights are too small, activations become subsequently smaller when they are passed through the layers. Conversely, if they are too large, the signal grows which each subsequent layer. Both effects hinder effective training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Glorot and Bengio$^1$ investigated this problem in more detail and presented a strategy to find the \"sweet spot\" for weight initialization that keeps the variance of the input and output gradient the same. Given certain assumptions, this can be achieved by drawing the weights from a Gaussian distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma)$ with zero mean and a standard deviation depending on the number of inputs  $n_\\mathrm{in}$ and outputs  $n_\\mathrm{out}$ of the layer.

    "## Convolutional layers\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional layers are without doubt one of the key elements of the success of neural networks in recent years. The main idea is simple: Convolution with trainable filters. They allow to learn which features are important for a given task in a data driven manner. One of their big advantages is that they inherently consider the spatial layout of the data. The animation below shows an example of a 2-D convolution of a padded input (blue) with a $3 \\times 3$ filter kernel that generates the output in green:\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "<img src=\"files/img/same_padding_no_strides.gif\" width=\"200\">\n",
    "<figcaption><center>Source: https://github.com/vdumoulin/conv_arithmetic</center></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will implement a 2-D convolutional layer that is fully connected in the depth/channel direction. Accordingly, given an input with $C$ channels, each filter has a shape of $M \\times N \\times C$, where $M$ and $N$ describe the spacial dimensions of the filter. The number of channels of the output depends on the number of filters  $S$ in the convolutional layer.\n",

    "<img src=\"files/img/conv_forward.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the input has $C = 3$ channels and the convolutional layer has $S = 2$ filters fully connected in depth direction. Accordingly, the output has two channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forward pass in a Conv layer:\n",
    "We can compute the forward pass in multiple ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### As a special case of a fully connected layer: Matrix multiplication\n",
    "Given a fixed input size, a convolutional layer can be considered as a special case of a fully connected layer. Accordingly, we can express the forward pass using a multiplication with a sparse matrix that represents the local connections within a convolutional layer. This allows us to use the same formulas as in the forward pass for the FC layer. While this presents a rather inefficient implementation, it can help to illustrate the connection between the convolutional and the FC layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Convolution\n",
    "The forward pass of a *convolutional* layer can of course also be straight forwardly implemented as a convolution. Different very efficient low-level implementations of convolutions are available, e.g., implementations that use fast Fourier transforms (FFT), generalized matrix multiplication (GEMM) or that are based on Winograd minimal filtering algorithms$^3$. In this tutorial, we will consider a \"naive\" convolution where we slide a filter over the image to facilitate a better understanding, and subordinate efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cross-correlation\n",
    "Cross-correlation is simply a convolution without a flipped filter. For filters that are initialized randomly, we are free to use cross-correlation instead of convolution in the forward pass. We will see that it saves us a bit of kernel flipping in the backward pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all cases, the bias in a convolutional layer is an element-wise addition of a scalar value for each output channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backward pass in a Conv layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the backward pass, we need to compute the gradient with respect to the weights of the convolutional kernel, the bias and the input, given the backpropagated error tensor $E_Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matrix multiplication\n",
    "Like in the forward pass, we can implement the backward pass by reusing the formulas from the fully connected layer if we express the convolution as a matrix multiplication. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Convolution/cross-correlation\n",
    "We may want to have a detailed look at the animation above, pick up pen and paper and track which pixels of the input/weight and correspondingly which pixels of the error contribute to respective gradient. For the gradient with respect to the input, we can then see that we need flipped kernel weights in the spacial dimensions (width and height). Alternatively, if we used convolution in the forward pass, we can now apply cross-correlation, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's have a look at the channels: If we have $S$ kernels in the forward pass, and the input has $C$ channels, we obviously need to re-arrange the weights to $C$ kernels with $S$ channels for the backward pass. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"files/img/restacking_filters.gif\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In the animation above shows that channel $c$ of $E_X$ depends only on the channel $c$ of the kernel weights. You can further see how the channels of the kernels can be recombined to compute the gradient with respect to the input. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the gradient with respect to the weights, you can observe that a correlation operation is necessary: First, the input has to be padded with half the kernel width. Then, each channel of the input has to be correlated with the channel $s$ of $E_Y$ to yield the gradient for kernel $s$. We have to compute\n",

    "<img src=\"files/img/conv_back_weights.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "If convolution was used in the forward pass, the result of this correlation represents the flipped gradient, so it has to be flipped back before an update. If correlation was used instead, we save this flipping operation. To really understand this, you may want to grab pen and paper again.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient with respect to the bias can be computed by simply summing over the respective channel.\n",
    "\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "A strided convolution can be used to downsample the input. From a mathematical perspective, this can be expressed as a convolution followed by subsampling. Similarly, in the backward pass, $E_Y$ is first upsampled (introducing zeros), and then processed as before.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Padding\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will restrict the padding strategy to \"same\" padding, meaning the input will be padded with zeros such that output after the convolution has the same size as the original input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reshaping\n",
    "Convolutional layers inherently expect the input to have a certain spatial layout with possibly arbitrary size, which is different to FC layers that expect a vector of fixed size. There are two common ways to make these operations interoperable: \n",
    "\n",
    " - Flatten the input before passing it to an FC layer\n",
    " - Have the convolutional layers reshape the input to the correct spatial layout\n",
    " \n",
    "Here, we will implement the first option. To this end, a FlattenLayer is introduced with the sole purpose of reshaping the input to be compatible with FC layers. As no computation is involved, the backward pass simply consists of reversing the reshaping.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation task\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, implement the classes ```FlattenLayer``` and ```ConvolutionalLayer``` as described above. The necessary parameters are further described in the method documentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: If you use 3D convolution/correlation (which makes sense from an implementation perspective), keep in mind that you potentially need to compensate for \"unnecessary\" flipping in the channel dimension in your implementation. Check your implementation by running the unit tests in the subsequent cell.\n",

In the backward pass, the subgradient is given by the colloquial rule \"the winner takes it all\".

If the stride is smaller than the neighborhood, the routed gradients for the respective pixels are summed up.\n",

    "## Dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "Most successful deep learning models use some regularization techniques intended to decrease the gap between training and test accuracy. The goal is to bias the model towards a model with lower training accuracy but better generalization capability. One prominent technique is dropout. It was for example used in the famous AlexNet network. \n",
    "The idea of this technique is to break dependencies between features by setting random activations to zero during training. This is typically done with a Bernoulli distribution: In each training iteration, the probability for a certain activation to \"drop out\" is $p$.\n",
    "The application of dropout shifts the mean of the activations because many elements are set to zero during training. At test time, when no element are dropped out, the mean is different, which can decrease performance. To combat this the \"training mean\" can be restored by multiplying all activations with $1 - p$ at test time.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Inverted dropout\n",
    "The multiplication at test time can be avoiding by rewriting dropout behaviour during training. This means that the dropout layer can actually be skipped completely during test time, allowing for faster inference. To this end, the activations are multiplied by $\\frac{1}{1 - p}$ after applying the stochastic function during training. This way, the mean is not changed by the layer and no operation needs to be performed during test time.\n",

    "## Summary and Outlook\n",
    "In this tutorial, we implemented some of the most common building blocks of neural networks, including fully connected layers, activation functions, convolutional layers and regularization operators. Finally, we combined these operators to working network.\n",
    "\n",
    "We covered only a small subset of elements that are relevant for neural networks. We encourage you to play with other operators, for example batch normalization$^5$, alternative activation functions, initialization strategies or recurrent units. You may also refactor the framework to experiment with different optimizers, like SGD with momentum, Adam or AdaGrad, or extend the framework to allow for weight decay.\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope you enjoyed this tutorial and gained a deeper understanding of neural network operators and frameworks. Have fun on your journey further into deep learning and neural networks!\n",
